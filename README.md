# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- having a better understanding of "flex-box"
- work on getting better at adding videos and animations
- spend more time on "custom forms"
- have a better understanding of width and not use width 100%

## Corrections

- remembering to add alternative fonts
- checking my margins
- double-check my folders and vendor folders to make sure I have the correct file path
